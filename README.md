## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Throughout this project I learned how to create a web page in Vue js. It's been a while since I wanted to try Vue so this was the best opportunity for me

### Continued development

I would like to use Vue js again but this time add a router like vue router, I think it could be really helpfull in the future
